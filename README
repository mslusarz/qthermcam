QThermCam - a tool for controlling Arduino-based cheap thermographic image
scanner which uses MLX90614ESF-BCI temperature sensor, 2 servos, laser
pointer, joystick, infra red receiver, SD card reader, pan/tilt bracket
and Arduino Uno (R3).

You can see hardware design at http://www.cheap-thermocam.tk/
(click "Old version" for build instructions).

This tool consists of 2 parts:
- Arduino software (in thermcam_arduino folder), which controls actual hardware
  (sensor and servos)
- desktop software - Qt application, which communicates with Arduino through
  USB and visualizes received data.
